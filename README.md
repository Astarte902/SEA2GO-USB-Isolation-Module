# SEA2GO-USB-Isolation-Module

A collaborative effort from Engineering students to make a dedicated Framework Laptop Expansion Card providing an isolated USB port for use with robotics, specifically for connecting to motor controllers.

The group working on this hopes to design additional fw expasion cards in the future for other engineering applications.

## TODO

- ~~Import any necessary files from the Framework Github Repo: https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/ExpansionCards~~
    - ~~Base KiCad design of Expansion Card~~
        - ~~Figure out whether regular or retrofit variants are needed/more suited~~
    - ~~CAD files for mechanical housing~~
        - Either decide on editing the existing stl files in software capable of that, or making the design ourselves based on provided dimensions in other CAD software.

- Electrical Schematic
    - Decide on method of isolation (Current suggestion from MegaKG is to utilise Diodes and optical signals)
    - Complete inital prototype schematic
    - Make and test prototype

- PCB Design
    - Start once Electrical Schematic has finished

- Housing
    - Ensure all chosen components fit within housing dimensions before progressing with Electrical Schematic
    - Test print base design before modifying for this project to ensure no other modifications are needed
